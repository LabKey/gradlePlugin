## gradlePlugin

The gradlePlugin jar is a jar file containing plugins, tasks, extensions and utilities used for building the [LabKey](https://www.labkey.org)
Server application and its modules.

If building your own LabKey module, you may choose to use these plugins or not.  They bring in a lot of functionality 
but also make certain assumptions that you may not want to impose on yoru module.  See the 
[LabKey documentation](https://www.labkey.org/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=gradleModules) for more information.
